# QuotesApp

QuotesApp is an inspirational Android application that displays motivating quotes in a stunning neumorphic UI. Built using the MVVM architectural pattern, the app leverages modern Android Jetpack components such as **LiveData** for reactive UI updates, **Data Binding** for reducing boilerplate, and **Retrofit** for seamless network communication. This project is an introductory example for testing, demonstrating unit tests, integration tests, and Espresso UI tests to ensure a reliable, maintainable codebase.

## Overview

QuotesApp aims to inspire users by blending beautifully rendered quotes with a modern neumorphic design that offers a soft, tactile user experience. Following the MVVM pattern, the project separates concerns cleanly: the UI is updated through LiveData automatically, data binding connects views effortlessly, and Retrofit handles network requests to fetch new quotes. This introductory project also serves as a comprehensive example of how to implement and execute testing practices within an Android application.

## Features

- **Stunning Neumorphic UI:**  
  Enjoy a modern, soft-edge design that gives the app a visually appealing, tactile look while keeping readability in focus.

- **Dynamic Inspirational Quotes:**  
  Retrieve and display motivational quotes from a remote source, updating the UI reactively.

- **MVVM Architecture:**  
  Clean separation of concerns with Models, Views, and ViewModels; this structure simplifies maintenance and makes the code highly testable.

- **Reactive UI Updates:**  
  LiveData automatically triggers UI refreshes when the underlying data changes.

- **Efficient Networking:**  
  Retrofit manages network communication, ensuring smooth and asynchronous data retrieval.

- **Comprehensive Testing:**  
  The project includes unit tests, integration tests, and Espresso UI tests as an introduction to best testing practices in Android.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **Architecture:** MVVM  
- **UI Components:**  
  - Neumorphic design elements (custom backgrounds and shadows)  
  - Data Binding for direct connection between views and data  
  - LiveData to reactively update the UI  
- **Networking:** Retrofit  
- **Testing Frameworks:**  
  - Unit Testing: JUnit, Mockito/MockK  
  //- Integration Testing: AndroidX Test libraries  
  //- UI Testing: Espresso  
- **Build Tool:** Gradle

## Architecture

The project is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:

- **Model:**  
  Data classes representing quotes and any API response objects, encapsulating the data layer.

- **ViewModel:**  
  Acts as the bridge between UI and data. It exposes LiveData for both quotes and UI states, while also holding business logic and coordinating with the Repository.

- **View:**  
  Activities and Fragments render the UI. They are bound to the ViewModel using Data Binding, ensuring that updates in the data are automatically reflected in the interface.

- **Repository:**  
  Handles data operations such as fetching quotes via Retrofit. It abstracts the details of network communication and may include caching if needed.

## Testing

This project is also designed as an introductory example for Android testing techniques:

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Validate ViewModel logic and Repository functions using JUnit and a mocking framework (e.g., Mockito/MockK).
  ```bash
  ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
